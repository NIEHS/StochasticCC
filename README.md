# Tracking dynamic cell-cell communication using a stochastic ordering framework for spatially resolved transcriptomics
Intercellular communication is fundamental to tissue homeostasis and disease progression, yet quantitatively resolving its dynamics across biological systems remains challenging. Although single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies now enable high-resolution profiling of cell-cell interactions, most computational approaches provide static summaries that overlook temporal and contextual variability. Here, we introduce \texttt{StochasticCC}, a novel probabilistic framework that models ligand-receptor signaling using full bivariate expression distributions. By leveraging stochastic ordering and Bayesian network modeling, \texttt{StochasticCC} accounts for correlation structure between ligands and receptors, adjusts for spatial and technical variation, and reduces false discoveries in heterogeneous or multi-modal datasets. In simulations, controlled biological studies, and benchmarking against four major communication frameworks, it consistently outperformed mean-based and product scoring methods. Applying \texttt{StochasticCC} to induced ulcerative colitis and tamoxifen-induced lung injury, we identify conserved fibroblast activation programs converging on FAK/Src-centered signaling modules, mediated by distinct ligand-receptor pairs such as Cxcl12-Itga5 and Spp1-Itgav/Itga8. This cross-organ convergence reveals a shared mechanotransduction axis underlying fibrotic remodeling, demonstrating that stochastic communication dynamics encode conserved signaling logic across inflammatory diseases. Collectively,  \texttt{StochasticCC} provides a generalizable framework for uncovering conserved signaling motifs across tissues and disease states.
